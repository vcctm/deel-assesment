Hello guys, so basically I create a simple Autocomplete using react/useState/useEffect. I should create some callbacks and memos to better performance but without enought time to do it!

Explaning: I use styled components for styling, so basically all styles is on there, the logic is really simple, receiving options as prop in autocomplete and an onChange function to return the selected option!

To run autocomplete: cd autocomplete, yarn, yarn dev
